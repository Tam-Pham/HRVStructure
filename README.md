# Unveiling the Structure of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Indices: A Data-driven Meta-clustering Approach


## Abstract

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be estimated using a myriad of mathematical indices, but the lack of systematic comparison between these indices renders the
interpretation and evaluation of results tedious. In this study, we assessed the relationship between 57 HRV metrics collected from 302 human recordings using a
variety of structure-analysis algorithms. We then applied a meta-clustering approach that combines their results to obtain a robust and reliable view of the observed
relationships. We found that HRV metrics can be clustered into 3 groups, representing the distribution-related features, harmony-related features and
frequency/complexity features. From there, we described and discussed their associations, and derived recommendations on which indices to prioritize for parsimonious,
yet comprehensive HRV-related data analysis and reporting.
